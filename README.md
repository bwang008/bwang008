<h1 align="center">Hello World 👋</h1>

###

<h3 align="left">👩‍💻 About Me</h3>

<p align="left">
I'm a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> based in Los Angeles, CA, with a unique background spanning a decade in power systems engineering. My professional journey began with building and maintaining the critical network simulation models that ensure grid stability for major utilities.
<br><br>
This deep experience with complex, real-world systems inspired me to pursue a <b>Master's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech</b> with a specialization in <b>Machine Learning</b>. I am passionate about applying my advanced ML skills to solve high-stakes problems in the tech and finance sectors, particularly in areas like energy trading, predictive modeling, and building intelligent automation pipelines.
</p>

- 🔭 I’m currently focused on completing my graduate studies and building a portfolio of ML projects.
- 📚 I'm deepening my expertise in predictive modeling, reinforcement learning, and computer vision.
- ⚡ In my free time, I enjoy exploring workflow automation tools and tinkering with game development in Unity.

<h3 align="left">🚀 Key Projects & Experience</h3>

<p align="left">
<i>While much of my recent academic and professional work resides in private repositories, below is a summary of key projects and experience.</i>
</p>

#### 🔹 LGBM Crude Oil Volatility Predictor
- Built a data processing pipeline to take 15 years of raw OHLCV data and reconstructed features out of it to predict price breakouts of 8% or more
- Used LightGBM as the backend, created a genetic algorithm to use for feature selection after generating over 100 different technical indicators to determine which feature combinations have highest information gain and feature importance
- Built a market simulator to handle futures price expiration and hand off between months to train effectively on back-adjusted futures data
- Edge over market is over 15% greater than randomized guessing with a heavily class skewed model
- Used data downsampling to deal with overwhelming class majority of the dataset being 'hold' or 'nothing' because of the nature of searching for black swan events. 

#### 🔹 Randomized Optimization for Combinatorial Problems (OL2)
- Applied randomized optimization algorithms like Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms to find high-quality solutions for computationally-intensive problems.
- The process involved implementing the algorithms, **collecting performance metrics** on solution quality and convergence speed, and **creating figures** to compare their effectiveness.
- This work was summarized in a comprehensive **report**, demonstrating the application of different optimization heuristics for solving complex problems.

#### 🔹 Network Modeling Engineer (10 Years Professional Experience)
- Designed, built, and maintained large-scale power flow simulation models for a major utility's Energy Management System (EMS).
- These models were critical for running a state estimator used by system operators for real-time grid analysis, contingency planning, and ensuring operational stability.
- Developed a deep expertise in analyzing complex systems and managing mission-critical data pipelines.

#### 🔹 Machine Learning for Trading (ML4T) Project
- Developed and backtested several trading strategies based on machine learning principles.
- Implemented algorithms to analyze historical market data, identify predictive signals, and generate trading orders.
- Gained experience with financial data analysis libraries in Python and frameworks for evaluating model performance in a trading context.

#### 🔹 Computer Vision: Neural Network for MNIST
- Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Engineered a model that successfully achieved **97% accuracy** on the test set.
- This project involved data preprocessing, model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
